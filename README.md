# myRetail Case Study

This is a case study for myRetail.


## Technology Choices

This project is a React app, built on top of Create React App (https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), in order to provide a configured webpack setup with es6 support, eslint, hot reloading, sass, and built in testing through jest.

This project is not currently ejected from create-react-app, although it easily could be if customizations to the build stack become necessary.

This project is built with modern browsers in mind, and is expected to work in IE9+. This is in line with React's support table (as well as Microsoft's).


### Open-Source Dependencies

On top of React / Create React App, this project utilizes the following OSS projects:
 * Sass, for CSS variables, mixins, nesting, and more.
 * React Helmet, for document head content management.
 * MomentJS, for easy date formatting.
 * Enzyme, for better testing support.
 

## Code Structure and Organization

Following modern web engineering practices, this project relies heavily on a Component-based structure for its UI elements. 

Each Component is meant to be a completely independent chunk of code, capable of being mixed and matched in any configuration. Each component is also responsible for managing its own style and appearance, and CSS files are imported through their respective JS component files, and ultimately combined by webpack into a single final build file.

With regards to nested style configurations / style overrides, a parent component *may* override a subcomponents style, however all declarations *must* be scoped to the component container. This will provide the correct CSS weight to override the child's own declarations.


## Code Style and Syntax

Coding style on this project is inspired by and largely follows the Airbnb style guide (https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), although there are a few exceptions.


## Installation

Clone or download this project and run 'npm install' to install all necessary dependencies.


## Running Development Server

Once installed, the development server can be run with 'npm run start-dev'.  By default, the development server will be http://localhost:3000/, although another port may be chosen if 3000 is not available.


## Testing

Unit testing is done through jest. Each component has its own Test file.

Run tests with the command 'npm test'. A code coverage report can be generated by running 'npm test -- --coverage'.

More information about testing through the Create React App setup can be found here: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#running-tests


## Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration is currently setup with Codeship, although integration can be done with any number of services. Continuous integration is an excellent way to pre-flight code and ensure successful builds and deployments.


## Production Build and Deployment

The project can be built into an optimized production build by running 'npm run build'. This will create a build directory with the final assets. The production build can be run on most any web server capable of serving static assets.

If client-side routing is ultimately expected, the web server will need to be capable of redirecting unknown url paths back to the index.html file. This is beyond the scope of this case study.

For the purposes of this case study, the code has been successfully built and deployed with Now (https://zeit.co/now)


## Potential Next Steps

This is a proof of concept and not yet a complete product. Here is a short list of some improvements and next steps that can be taken.


### Carousel Component

The Carousel Component would benefit from a drag handler, especially considering mobile devices. It is also currently not fully compatible with IE9, due to reliance on css transitions, and the transitionend js event hook. A workaround for the browser should be implemented.

Additionally, due to this transitionend event, testing for this component is also incomplete.


### Picture Component

The intent with the Picture component is to use the <picture> element to render the appropriate asset depending on the screen resolution and pixel density. Since the sample data did not include retina imagery, this component was not improved upon, and a simpler approach was used.


### Price Component

This component will need additional logic and presentation work to handle different types of offers.


### QuantityField Component

A nice addition here would be to continuously increment / decrement the number if the toggle button is held down. This can be done with a timeout that will fire repeatedly after a mousedown event, until a mouseup event is fired.
